/**
 * Wires a native DOM listener through the diff via addEventListener, so
 * native events flow through the same add/remove lifecycle as custom ones —
 * no inline `on<event>` attributes.
 *
 * add() binds `Brick.bindEvent(path, domType, event, capture)`; remove()
 * unbinds it. When remove() fires because the handler was dropped from a
 * surviving element it does the real detach; when it fires because the node
 * itself left the tree the element is already gone, so the emitted unbind is
 * a harmless no-op (the browser drops the listeners with the node and the
 * client's patch handler scrubs them as it removes the element).
 *
 * `$event` is the logical event name (the dispatched server event); `$domType`
 * is the real DOM event name passed to addEventListener (e.g. 'change' for
 * the logical 'upload').
 *
 * `$client` controls how a dispatch reaches the server: true (default) keeps
 * the current behaviour — an AJAX POST that diff/patches the current page;
 * false makes the listener submit a real form POST, a full-page navigation
 * the server answers with a freshly rendered HTML document.
